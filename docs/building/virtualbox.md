# Virtual Box

This section describes how to build KidneyOS using VirtualBox.

<!--
TODO: implement the building of VM images (using packer:
https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/integrations/hashicorp/virtualbox seems
like a good approach), save the images somewhere they can be downloaded, and
then provide usage instructions.

We should base the images on Ubuntu since it's most common (even though it would
be way easier to build a purely NixOS image) so that people don't have a
terrible time trying to set up their IDE/editor inside the VM.
