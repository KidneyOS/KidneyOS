## Clone Repository

Clone the repository and `cd` into the resulting directory. (Depending on how your instructor wants you to submit your work, they may have given you an alternate repository URL. If so, use that URL instead of the one below.)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/KidneyOS/KidneyOS
cd KidneyOS
```
