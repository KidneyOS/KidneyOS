# Introduction

<!-- BEGIN mdsh -->
KidneyOS is a toy OS written in Rust, designed for teaching operating systems concepts. It is loosely based on [PintOS](https://pintos-os.org/) (the name "KidneyOS" refers to kidney beans, and is a joke about how PintOS can be read as "pintos", another kind of bean). It is still a work in progress, and is not yet ready for use. If you're interested in using KidneyOS for teaching when it's ready, you can "watch" the repository for releases on [GitHub](https://github.com/KidneyOS/KidneyOS).

KidneyOS is being developed by students at the University of Toronto. The project is supervised by [Professor Jack Sun](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sunk/).
